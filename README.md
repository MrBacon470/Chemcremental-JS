# Chemcremental-JS

My most popular game, Chemcremental remade with Javascript rather than C#

# Differences
Less Content (As of right now)<br>
Redone UI<br>
Different Number Library<br>
Different Balancing Changes
# Known Problems/Notes
Background Hover dissapears behind subscripts<br>
Tab Background remains gray after unlock until refreshed<br>
Note: Game will remain in beta until after the second layer is implemented
